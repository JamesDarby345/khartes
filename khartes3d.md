# Getting started with khartes3d

Using khartes3d is a lot like using khartes,
but there are a couple of differences to keep in mind.

The main difference is in how you start a new fragment.

It is important that you place the first 5 points
in a certain way.

0) Make sure you have pressed the `New Fragment` button.

1) The first 3 points should be placed in the upper-left
window (the "IMG" window), in clockwise order around the
center of the scroll.  Khartes draws these points in a larger
size, to emphasize that they are the starting points.

2) Place the cursor over the middle point (point 2), and
hit the `x` key.  This will center point 2 in all 3 windows.

3) In either the X window or the Y window (whichever seems to
provide a clearer view) place the final 2 points (points 4 and 5)
on opposite sides of point 2.
The order does not matter.  Note that the surface now appears in
the map view, and the points are redrawn in a normal size.

That's it!

From there, proceed as you would before.  
As with the 2D version of khartes,
try to maintain a sort of squarish layout in map view.  Try to
avoid long skinny triangles.

### Beginner tips

1) Save regularly!

2) Turn on the tracking cursor (press the `t` key to 
toggle the tracking cursor on and off).

3) In the map view, look at the 3 axes (green, red, blue)
to decide which data slice to add points to.  I tend to
add points in the green window (the IMG window) and in
the window corresponding to whichever axis is most perpendicular
to the green axis.  (In the picture above, the blue axis fits
this criterion).

### Advanced tips

Once you have placed a hundred or so points, there are some
advanced things to keep in mind.
